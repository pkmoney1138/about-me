  		<h1>Introduction</h1>
  		<p>I'm basically a prototypical geek, and I mean that in a good way. I love (or, rather, am obsessed with) movies, music, comics, and video games, in that order. I have a Master's Degree in Film Theory, but haven't been able to translate that into a full time job. And that's why I'm here, to hopefully translate my other love, computers, into a career.</p>
  		<p>My family and friends are most important to me. Also, doing something with my life is important, something that doesn't just fill the hours but actually fulfills me.</p>

  		<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  		<p>I was born in Dallas, Texas but moved to Germany when I was only 10 months old. We moved back to the US of A in 1987, to Miami, FL, and I have been here ever since.</p>

  		<h1>More About Me</h1>
  		<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
 		 <p>I love watching movies, live them and breathe them. I like to review them too. Also, I listen to alot of music... alot of music! Going hand in hand with that, I also like going to concerts. Are these really hobbies? I guess so. I mean, I usually spend my free time watching movies and listening to music, so, yes, I guess those are my hobbies</p>
	  	<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
	  	<p>My dream job is...I don't like this question, so I'm just going to be vague: Something that pays well and that I really enjoy doing. There! Take that, question.</p>
  		<h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  		<p id="music">I think a better question would be what haven't I been listening to lately? Since that answer would be much shorter. Still, here's but a small sample of what I <strong>have</strong> been listening to: Weezer, Manic Street Preachers, Bob Mould, Andy Williams (thought I'd sneak that one in there), Arctic Monkeys, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Foals, Kodaline, Underworld, etc. I could keep going, but I won't.

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>What follows are the projects I have created while taking Thinkful's Front End Development course</p> 
        <div class="ny-times">
            <h1>New York Times Hack</h1>
            <p>This project was meant as an exercise in familiarizing ourselves with Google Chrome's Developer Tools.</p>
            <p>Using these developer tools, we had to change the front page of the New York Times in any way we saw fit.</p>
            <p>I decided to have a little fun with the headlines of that day</p>

        <div class="clone">
            <h1>Karma Landing Page Clone</h1>
            <p>Next, we were tasked with cloning the front page of another website.</p>
