	<section class="introduction-section w-and-m">
  		<h1>Introduction</h1>
  		<p>I'm basically a prototypical geek, and I mean that in a good way. I love (or, rather, am obsessed with) movies, music, comics, and video games, in that order. I have a Master's Degree in Film Theory, but haven't been able to translate that into a full time job. And that's why I'm here, to hopefully translate my other love, computers, into a career.</p>
  		<p>My family and friends are most important to me. Also, doing something with my life is important, something that doesn't just fill the hours but actually fulfills me.</p>

	<section class="location-section w-and-m">
  		<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  		<p>I was born in Dallas, Texas but moved to Germany when I was only 10 months old. We moved back to the US of A in 1987, to Miami, FL, and I have been here ever since.</p>

  		<h1>More About Me</h1>
  		<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
 		 <p>I love watching movies, live them and breathe them. I like to review them too. Also, I listen to alot of music... alot of music! Going hand in hand with that, I also like going to concerts. Are these really hobbies? I guess so. I mean, I usually spend my free time watching movies and listening to music, so, yes, I guess those are my hobbies</p>
	  	<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
	  	<p>My dream job is...I don't like this question, so I'm just going to be vague: Something that pays well and that I really enjoy doing. There! Take that, question.</p>
  		<h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  		<p id="music">I think a better question would be what haven't I been listening to lately? Since that answer would be much shorter. Still, here's but a small sample of what I have been listening to: Weezer, Manic Street Preachers, Bob Mould, Andy Williams (thought I'd sneak that one in there), Arctic Monkeys, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Foals, Kodaline, Underworld, etc. I could keep going, but I won't.

    <h1 class="intro">Projects</h1>
    <section class="projects w-and-m">
        <p>What follows are the projects I have created while taking Thinkful's Front End Development course. I believe that these projects are indicative of the knowledge I have accumulated while working through Thinkful's program.</p> 
        <div class="ny-times">
            <h1>New York Times Hack</h1>
            <p>This project was meant as an exercise in familiarizing ourselves with Google Chrome's Developer Tools. Using these developer tools, we had to change the front page of the New York Times in any way we saw fit. I decided to have a little fun with the headlines of that day.</p>
            <div class="frozen"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="clone">
            <h1>Karma Landing Page Clone</h1>
            <p>Next, we were tasked with cloning the front page of another website.</p>
            <a href="http://pkmoney1138.github.io/startup-landing-page-clone/"><div class="webpage"></div></a>
        <div class="street-fighter">
            <h1>Street Fighter</h1>
            <p>As an introduction to JavaScript and, more specifically, jQuery, we created this project. Positioning and hiding/showing elements were also a big part of this app.</p>
            <a href="http://pkmoney1138.github.io/jquery-streetfighter/main.html"><div class="ryu"></div></a>
        </div>
        <div class="not-lost">
            <h1>Shopping List App</h1>
            <p>You don't have to be into "The Clash" or punk music in general to enjoy this shopping list app, but it helps!</p>
            <a href="http://pkmoney1138.github.io/not-lost-supermarket/"><div class="shopping w-and-m"></div></a>
        </div>
        <div class="hot-or-cold">
            <h1>Hot or Cold App</h1>
            <p>I didn't design this project, but I did get it to function properly with jQuery. This one's less about design and more about programming.</p>
            <a href="http://pkmoney1138.github.io/hot-or-cold-refactor/#"><div class="hot-or-cold-app"></div></a>
        </div>
        <div class="quiz">
            <h1>Superhero Quiz</h1>
            <p>A fun(I hope) interactive quiz about superheroes. This project was all about creating and using objects with JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
            <a href="http://pkmoney1138.github.io/superhero-quiz/"><div class="superheroes"></div></a>
        </div>
        <div class="api">
            <h1>API-Hack</h1>
            <p>Last, but not least, we learned to interact with APIs and how to extract data from them in object form and then use that data in some form on a website. I decided to interact with a movie database api and show poster images and some cast and crew info for any movie a user may want to look up.</p>
